IT’IS has released NeuroRat V4.0, the first neuro-functionalized animal model. The new whole-body model has been created as part of o2S2PARC, a project funded by the NIH Common Fund’s Stimulating Peripheral Activity to Relieve Conditions (SPARC) program. The anatomy of NeuroRat V4.0 has been segmented from structural magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography image data that has been acquired by the Animal Imaging Center of ETH Zurich and the University of Zurich.

NeuroRat V4.0 includes 179 tissues and functionalized nerve trajectories for neuromodulation investigations. For noncommercial applications, it can be enriched with a co-registered version of the Waxholm Space Atlas of the Sprague Dawley Rat Brain for enhanced neuroanatomical analysis.

NeuroRat V4.0 has been enhanced by additional Sim4Life functions, such as the poser and automated tissue assignment, and is optimized for the platform in general. It also comes with pre-assigned material properties that are based on the IT’IS Tissue Properties Database.
