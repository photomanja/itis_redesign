Redi's abstract entitled "Electrical Impedance Tomography for Online Perfusion/Temperature Monitoring during Hyperthermia Treatment" focused on investigating the feasibility of integrating electrical impedance tomography as a noninvasive temperature and/or perfusion monitoring technique with sufficient accuracy into the hyperthermia treatment workflow.

ICHO2021 was organized by the European Society of Hyperthermic Oncology (ESHO) and was held as a virtual conference, from October 6 â€“ 8, 2021.
